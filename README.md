# RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection

## Plan of action
- setup a GCP workspace (using [this guide](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/discussion/111029#latest-640644) as an example)
- try using fastai v2, with its native DICOM processing capabilities, based off of jhoward's notebooks from Kaggle (downloaded and saved in [](notebooks/jhoward))
